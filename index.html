        A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of
        instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages
        are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

        The period from the 1960s to the late 1970s brought the development of
        the major language paradigms now in use:

          APL introduced array programming and influenced functional

          ALGOL refined both structured procedural programming and the
          discipline of language specification; the "Revised Report on the
          Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60" became a model for how later language
          specifications were written.

          C was developed between 1969 and 1973 as a system programming language
          for the Unix operating system and remains popular.

        <li>
          The 1980s were years of relative consolidation. C++ combined
          object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government
          standardized Ada, a systems programming language derived from Pascal
          and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere,
          vast sums were spent investigating so-called "fifth-generation"
          languages that incorporated logic programming constructs.[41] The
          functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp.
          Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated
          upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.
        </li>
        <li>
          One important trend in language design for programming large-scale
          systems during the 1980s was an increased focus on the use of modules
          or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula-2, Ada, and ML all
          developed notable module systems in the 1980s, which were often wedded
          to generic programming constructs.
        </li>
        <li>
          The rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s created
          opportunities for new languages. Perl, originally a Unix scripting
          tool first released in 1987, became common in dynamic websites. Java
          came to be used for server-side programming, and bytecode virtual
          machines became popular again in commercial settings with their
          promise of "Write once, run anywhere" (UCSD Pascal had been popular
          for a time in the early 1980s). These developments were not
          fundamentally novel; rather, they were refinements of many existing
          languages and paradigms (although their syntax was often based on the
          C family of programming languages).
        </li>
        <li>
          Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and
          research. Current directions include security and reliability
          verification, new kinds of modularity (mixins, delegates, aspects),
          and database integration such as Microsoft's LINQ.

          Fourth-generation programming languages (4GL) are computer programming
          languages which aim to provide a higher level of abstraction of the
          internal computer hardware details than 3GLs. Fifth-generation
          programming languages (5GL) are programming languages based on solving
          problems using constraints given to the program, rather than using an
          algorithm written by a programmer.
